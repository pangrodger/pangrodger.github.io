<h3>Hi all. I work at UC Pavement Research Center and one of my jobs is to separate rock samples into specific weights. However, I cannot separate these samples by hand because they must be naturally separated by a machine, which only splits it in half. This would normally make the process take a very long time, but I wrote this algorithm to determine the least amount of machine separations to achieve the desired weight.</h3>
